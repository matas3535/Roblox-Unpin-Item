# Roblox Unpin Item
Tool that allows you to permanently remove a pinned item from your roblox profile, Made as there doesn't seem to be any publicly available ones out there.

Press **CTRL + Shift + I** to open the developer tools or find it in your browsers application menu dropdown, Then head over to the console tab and paste the code from the [File Page](https://github.com/matas3535/Roblox-Unpin-Item/blob/main/program.js) (Keep in mind you have to type 'allow pasting' to be able to paste code into the console).

Should look like this if it succeeded:
